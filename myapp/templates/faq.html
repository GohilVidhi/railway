        <h1>FAQ</h1>

        <h3>Q: How do I place an order?</h3>
        <p>A: To place an order, simply follow the steps below for a seamless ordering experience:

            Select the item you wish to place an order for (If stitching will be needed, be sure to add stitching
            options)
            Add the item to your shopping cart.
            Click on your shopping cart to proceed to the checkout.
            Enter your billing & shipping details and any applicable coupon codes.
            Select your method of payment - credit card details will be entered on the same page while those paying with
            paypal will be redireceted to the paypal website to complete the order.
            Woohoo! You've successfully placed an order. You will be able to view your order # and order details on the
            final screen. You'll also receive an order confirmation e-mail at the e-mail address provided by you at
            checkout.</p>

        <h3>Q: I've placed an order, when will I receive it?</h3>
        <p>A: The processing time required to get each product ready for dispatch is listed on the respective product
            page. If you've ordered a Ready to Ship item, it will be dispatched within 48 hrs (2 business days). If your
            order contains multiple items with different processing times, your order will be dispatched only when all
            products are ready.
            Example: You've placed an order for three products. The processing time for product A is 48 hrs, product B
            is 7 days and product C is 21 days. Your order will be dispatched within 21 days. Once your order is
            dispatched, you will receive your order within 4-7 business days.</p>

        <h3>Q: How will my order be delivered to me?</h3>
        <p>A: We at Lashkaraa only work with reputed carriers such as UPS, FedEx, DHL, and Aramex. Your order will be
            dispatched through one of these reputed couriers. You'll also be receiving a tracking number in your
            shipment confirmation e-mail so you may also keep track on your order status.</p>

        <h3>Q: How can I check the status of my order?</h3>
        <p>A: Checking your order status is very easy - simply log in to your Lashkaraa account and proceed to My
            Account section. From there, click on the Orders tab, where you will be able to view the item(s) ordered and
            respective status for each. Alternatively, you may also e-mail us at info@lashkaraa.com alongside your order

        <h3>Q: I just placed an order but now want to cancel it. How can I do this? </h3>
        <p>A: Please e-mail info@lashkaraa.com immediately with your order # and request to cancel. Order cancellation
            requests must be received within 24 hours of order placement for a 100% refund back to your used method of
            payment. Order cancellation requests made after this period are only approved on a case-to-case basis,
            depending on if the product(s) in your order are nearing completion for dispatch. If your order cancellation
            request is approved, you will receive a refund in the form of a store credit only. If you need a refund back
            to your card, a 15% re-stocking fee will be applied.

            Please note that READY TO SHIP items (items with a dispatch time of 48 hrs) cannot be cancelled once the
            order is placed. When you place an order for a Ready To Ship product with us, this item immediately goes
            into processing as we have to dispatch this item from our warehouse within 48 hours as noted online.</p>

        <h3>Q: Why must I inform you within 24 hours of order placement if I want to cancel my order? </h3>
        <p>A: As soon as you place your order, we get to work. At this point, the picking, customization and logistics
            for your order has already begun, hence we request all cancellation requests be reported to us within 24
            hours of order placement only.</p>
